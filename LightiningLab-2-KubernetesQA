Question # 3
Create a cronjob called dice that runs every one minute. Use the Pod template located at /root/throw-a-dice. The image throw-dice randomly returns a value between 1 and 6. The result of 6 is considered success and all others are failure.
The job should be non-parallel and complete the task once. Use a backoffLimit of 25.
If the task is not completed within 20 seconds the job should fail and pods should be terminated.


apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob

  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:

          restartPolicy: OnFailure

Question: 4
Create a pod called my-busybox in the dev2406 namespace using the busybox image. The container should be called secret and should sleep for 3600 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.

Make sure that the pod is scheduled on master and no other node in the cluster.

Answer:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx2406
  namespace: dev2406
  resourceVersion: "588"
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: nginx
    resources: {}
    terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
    terminationMessagePolicy: File
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
      name: default-token-7pgss
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: default-token-7pgss
    secret:
      defaultMode: 420
      secretName: default-token-7pgss

Question 5
Create a single ingress resource called ingress-vh-routing. The resource should route HTTP traffic to multiple hostnames as specified below:

The service video-service should be accessible on http://watch.ecom-store.com:30093/video

The service apparels-service should be accessible on http://apparels.ecom-store.com:30093/wear
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-vh-routing
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: watch.ecom-store.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /video
        backend:
          serviceName: video-service
          servicePort: 8080
  - host: apparels.ecom-store.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /wear
        backend:
          serviceName: apparels-service
          servicePort: 8080

Check: curl -v http://watch.ecom-store.com:30093/video
For port of services, run kubectl get services

Question 6
A pod called dev-pod-dind-878516 has been deployed in the default namespace. 
Inspect the logs for the container called log-x and 
redirect the warnings to /opt/dind-878516_logs.txt on the master node

Answer:
k logs dev-pod-dind-878516 log-x | grep WARN > /opt/dind-878516_logs.txt
