Question: 1
Create a Persistent Volume called log-volume. 

It should make use of a storage class name manual. 

It should use RWX as the access mode and have a size of 1Gi. The volume should use the hostPath /opt/volume/nginx
Next, create a PVC called log-claim requesting a minimum of 200Mi of storage. This PVC should bind to log-volume.
Mount this in a pod called logger at the location /var/www/nginx. This pod should use the image nginx:alpine.

Answer:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: log-volume
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: "/opt/volume/nginx"

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: log-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Mi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: logger
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: log-claim
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx:alpine
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/www/nginx"
          name: task-pv-storage


Test:
Kubes commands
kubectl get pv log-volume (check pv status, needs to be bound)
k get pods (check if its running)
When persistentVolumeclaim is deleted, you can set persistentVolumereclaimpolicy to retain, delete or recycle (only data deleted)
